= List of questions to OTel

== OTel-API

* Why can't I retrieve a span from context via propagators?

```java
  Context extractedContext = OpenTelemetry.getPropagators().getTextMapPropagator()
        .extract(Context.current(), httpExchange, getter);
  Span serverSpan = null;
  try (Scope scope = ContextUtils.withScopedContext(extractedContext)) {
    serverSpan = tracer.getCurrentSpan();
  }
```

whereas it would be great no to put the span in scope and just retrieve it:

```java
  Context extractedContext = OpenTelemetry.getPropagators().getTextMapPropagator()
        .extract(Context.current(), httpExchange, getter);
  Span span = ContextUtils.getSpan(extractedContext);
```

* How can I continue a span? (*File an issue* - in the specification repo - supports join?)
** How can I continue it having `SpanContext`?
* How can I create a builder for a span to add `kind` ?

== OTel-SDK jar

According to https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/master/QUICKSTART.md[Quickstart] I shouldn't be using OTel-SDK jar, however the API jar is missing features.

* Why sampling API is not in `-api` jar?
** Due to this you can't really create any bridges between libraries and OTel
* How can I use my own tracer when using the SDK jar that has a tracer in META-INF already?
